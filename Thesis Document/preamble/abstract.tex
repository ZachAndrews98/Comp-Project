\chapter*{Abstract}

Docker is a framework that is slowly being adopted by more and more areas within
industry and is only increasing in popularity. This adoption and popularity is
spurred along by the ability for software to be delivered and deployed remotely
and for Docker Containers to only allocate the minimal amount of processing
power and memory to run unlike virtual machines \cite{dockerDocs}. However, with
different methods of installation across Operating Systems, and even with
Operating Systems, many issues can arise when trying to go through the
installation process. Another large issue is simply with trying to remember all
of the commands and arguments that are required to build and run some of the
simplest containers. As such, several companies have released and developed
graphical interfaces for the Docker Engine, including Docker which allow for
users to create and manage the images and containers that are on their local
machines. However, none of these tools assist in the installation of Docker or
the creation of Docker images and containers. A tool which assists with each of
these elements would ensure that Docker is able to be adopted by more people and
areas within industry.
